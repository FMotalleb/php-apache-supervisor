The only change you may need to apply to your Dockerfiles is replacing the image name from `php:<tag>` with `ghcr.io/fmotalleb/php-supervisor:<tag>`. (only supported tags are stable Debian builds as provided above)

* If you need to build this image for any other tags
  * Note 1. Alpine is not supported
  * Note 2. Only fpm or Apache are available
  * Note 3. In order to build an image you need to use a Debian +buster base image (currently Buster and Bookworm)  

```
git clone https://github.com/FMotalleb/php-supervisor.git
cd php-supervisor
docker build . -f ./<fpm or apache>/Dockerfile --build-arg="PHP_VERSION=<Debian Tag>"
```

All images are based on a stable Debian version derived from PHP's original image.

Using build arguments enables you to customize the build process. With this Dockerfile,
you are able to set the desired Composer/PHP version, Composer arguments, default PHP mods, Apache mods, and more.

* Example build command to build this image for php:8.1-apache-bookworm and latest version of composer

```bash
docker build . -t my_php:8.1 --build-arg "COMPOSER_IMAGE_TAG=latest" --build-arg "PHP_VERSION=8.1-apache-bookworm"
```
